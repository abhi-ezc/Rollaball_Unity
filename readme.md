# Rollaball

Welcome to Rollaball, a game created using Unity Engine. This project serves as my first venture into game development using Unity, crafted primarily for learning purposes.

## About the Game

Rollaball is a simple yet addictive game where players control a ball to collect as many points as possible within a time limit of 60 seconds. This initial version of the game was created in just 2 hours of learning Unity, and it will continue to evolve over time with additional features and improvements.

## Getting Started

To play Rollaball, you have a couple of options:

1. **Play in Unity Editor:** Simply open the project in Unity and run the game from the editor.
2. **Build the Game:** Use Unity Engine to build the game for your desired platform and enjoy it as a standalone application.
